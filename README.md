# Hi, I'm Danil 👋

I am a full-stack developer with over 2 years of valuable commercial experience, with a focus on frontend development.

On the frontend side, I'm good in React and its entire ecosystem, harnessing its power to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I take pride in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that leave a lasting impression on users.

When it comes to the backend, I'm experienced in leveraging the power of Node.js (with Express) to create robust and scalable server-side solutions. Additionally, I've had the pleasure of working with C# (.NET), expanding my skill set and tackling diverse challenges.

My journey as a developer has been driven by a curiosity for innovative solutions and a dedication to continuous learning. I believe that a proactive and collaborative approach is key to delivering successful projects that exceed expectations.
